# Additional Unix Commands

Below is a brief list of common Unix commands typically found in mature operating systems. OptrixOS implements a small subset, but these examples may help when extending the shell:

- `ls` – list directory contents
- `cp` – copy files
- `mv` – move or rename files
- `rm` – remove files
- `mkdir` – create directories
- `rmdir` – remove directories
- `cat` – display file contents
- `touch` – create empty files
- `echo` – print text to the terminal
- `grep` – search for text within files
- `chmod` – change file permissions
- `chown` – change file ownership
- `find` – search for files
- `pwd` – print current directory
- `whoami` – display current user

This list is not exhaustive but covers many commands expected on a Unix-like system.
